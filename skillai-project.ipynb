For example, it also generated qualities such as \"strength and lifting capacity\" which while are trainable, can be thought of as physical qualities rather than skills. Second, while it provided a structured answer (i.e., grouped skills and qualities in groups) it generated an answer which can be too broad and overwhelming for a user.
